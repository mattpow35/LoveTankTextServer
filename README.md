# LoveTankTextServer

This is a text server written in python using Redis as the database and Twilio API for the texting service.

Love tank was a project we built for the 2022 BYU Sandbox hackathon. By adding people to the database you can sign them to receive texts that ask them to update their "love tank". The love tank is a scale from 1-10 on how much love you are feeling from your significant other that day. The app is designed to help fascilitate communication between partners in a relationship. We take your updated score and send it your partner who can then be informed in a simple way how their partner is feeling. This will hopefully create relationships where communication of feelings can be initiated easily.
